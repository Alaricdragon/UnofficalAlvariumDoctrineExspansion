ITS THE SMUG TOOL. ITS HOTKEY IS 'S' AND IT IS THE anti-alius
new fleet design:
    a new fleet design is now required.
    lets take the things i like about xhan empires alvarium docturing:
    remove the things i dont like:
        -the over complecated and almost messy way that the hull is detailed (the curves being a mess)
        -the green outer armor (but only sometimes. i love it on the larger ships, but it looks messy sometimes).
        -the green armor on the -outside- of the ships??
    and add some more things i like:
        -the engin phum
        -the green name
        -the grey armor colar (although maybe a little tint of green in it?)
        -the preference of green in there desing (but not being all green)
        -the bridges (for both drones and not drones.)

        -the energy wepons.
        -the 'vill' fighters concept
        -the forward facing hanger bays (for the 'vill' fighters).
        -the idea of tiny drone ships and making them out of organics.
    things i dont like about -that- ship: (being the one on the discord page about graphics lib)
        no engins =(
            -although, it looks very sexy on that ship, with its little waves of motion. god it looks good. but not for me here. it would not fit the desing.
             thats for something really scary, and not just a line ship.
    things i like about -that- ship:
        the more simple hull desing (for details) looks less messy.
        the layered looking armor.
        the green lights in the hull.
        the way the wepons seem to be indented a little into the hull, as apposed to on top of it.
        the colar of the main hull (like steel)

    so combining that, i get the following i need to do:
        1) pick a color pallet (for hull, weapons, glows, exsta) (should do the hull first. i want something steal, but slightly green....)
        2) redesign all my ships (AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)
        3) build my own weapons and effects (I can use xhans for now, but i need to not have that).
        4) build my own special hull mod (like 'organic hull' or something, but what would it do? make me reselect to emp? like what?? I need to reserch a little...)
        5) move all ship designs into this file.
        6) create a new 'vill' fighter. try not to just copy xhan empire please.
            -names: assembly drone?
            bio-constructor?
            bio-assembler?
        7) rename hiveships to:
            bio-constructor ships?
            bio-forge ships?
        8) rename the avlarium docturing to:
            ????
so the ships basic desing: (keep in mind: there are differences between droneships and hive ships)
    bridge:
        hive ship:
            I like the flat green dots around a center part of the craft it. looks good. Hopefully no one accuses me of plagerisum if i do that...?
        drone ship:
            I like the small little 'bumps' at the front of the ship. I really like them. but i need to change them somehow....
    engines:
        hive ship:
            remember: engines tend to be connected to the rest of the hull with -multiple- methods. its not enough to -just- have it be partly hidden in the hull...
            or is it? its what the xhan empier ships did. although there engines were very complecated. so i might be in a bit of a pickle here...
            mmmm
        drone ship:
            --
    shape:
        the Alvarium docturoms shap was curvey. very mush so. there were no hard lines anywere.
        that was ok, but lets do something diffrent:
            1) let there be hard lines instead of curves.
            2) lets there be curveys over longer parts of the ship (to stop it looking like stright lines everywere)

            now the stillhouse: I do have a few drawn in my notbook, that have a function simaler to waht i describe....
        hive ship:
        drone ship:
    hull:
        mmmmmmmm
        I like the overlaping plates. how do i handle this...
        in the MP4 i downloaded, that ships overlapping plates are all the same base color. its just shading that changes the way it all looks.
        im going to try to manage that. that type if shading. it will be hard, but no were near as hard as Alvarium doctoring.
        hive ship:
        drone ship:
    outer hull:
        ....
        hive ship:
        drone ship:
    weapons slots:
        I like the concept of the weapons being indented in my hull.
        I like it a loot. in fact, i like it so mush im going to try and do it.

            most missiles in the game are not turrets, but are rather hard ponits on the edges of a ships hull. should i keep that up?

    weapons:
        NOTE: this is general design. not exact ways how the weapons must look.

    hanger bays:
        construction ships:
            I would still like them to face forwards, at somewhere around the center of the ships front. this
            will let it look more like something more civilian, and not combat (why have fighter bays exposed like that.)
        not construction ships:
            make there hangers be more 'inside' the hull (still at the edges). also make them be more turds the back of the ship, and face backwards.
            this marks a clear difference between construction hangers and military ones.

                phase drone: (started)
                    so i have started this ship.
                    I like the way the armor plates look.
                    I like the way the bride looks.
                    i think it looks fucking good.
                    what i need to do:
                        1)(done) add wepon sloots.
                            im thinking, 2 side weapons, 2 forward weapons? but then i have no points for PD?
                            maybe 2 side PDs, and 3 forward hard ponits? thats 5 guns though....
                        2)(started) add engions:
                            this is going to go on the back of the core, and partly under the armor if i can manage that...
                            ok, i looked at some relevant information:
                            the green glow i want on my engion is managed by the game itself. so there is no need to create green into the code.
                            I still need to decide how the engines are going to look though....
                        3)(started) shape the edges of the craft
                            the edges of the craft are blocky as flip right now. i need to do something about this.
                        4)(not done. not needed????) add armor plates on the armor
                            right now, the armor is not very interesting. adding some 'plate' looking structures onto the wings might help...
                        5)(not started yet.) add other detailes:
                            small lights.
                            pipes?
                            wire
                            other things...
