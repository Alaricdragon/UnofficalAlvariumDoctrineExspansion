notes:
	I have started to look at what is required to start to produce ships. and im going to be honest: the battleship i want makes me nervus.
	as a resalt, i think im going to need to do 2 things: 
	1: i am going to have to build a diffrent drone first. im going to have to try and pixle art some of it, ebcause i fear i will need to, to beable to get the detales right.
	2: I am going to have to go onto the discord, and see if i can learn anything about spriting. i dont know what im doing help
