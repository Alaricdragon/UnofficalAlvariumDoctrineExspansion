notes:
	I have started to look at what is required to start to produce ships. and im going to be honest: the battleship i want makes me nervus.
	as a resalt, i think im going to need to do 2 things: 
	1: i am going to have to build a diffrent drone first. im going to have to try and pixle art some of it, ebcause i fear i will need to, to beable to get the detales right.
	2: I am going to have to go onto the discord, and see if i can learn anything about spriting. i dont know what im doing help

note on creating a ship:
    the 'mod dictionary' should NOT likely be the xhan empire mod link it to my own mod, and make sure it loads afterwards.
    'variants' are required for custom ships to spawn in NPC fleets. it is not a variant for player????
    also, try to keep the bounding box with as few parts as possable.

notes on creating a weapon:
    wepons are made of 3 parts:
        1) the static part of the gun
        2) the moving part of the gun
        3) the glow of the gun
    each needs a separate sprite.

notes on fighters:
    fighters are basicly ships. everythings the same.
    if i want the wepon on the fighter to be visable, i should make it a not 'hidden' wepon. if not, i should most certenly not do that.

data on how ships are desinged:
please note, that do to desing of the crafts, both 'drones' and 'hiveships' have diffrent requirements for many things
bridge:
	hiveship:
	    one cetner bridge. seems rather flat? lots of green lights, and tends to go in a circle around. can be oddly shaped
	drone:
	    one or 2 little dots of green light, facing forwards. they tend to be on center, but when they are not, they are smetrical. can have a bit of houseing, unless its ubstructed by armor
engions:
	hiveship:
	    most of the unarmerd back of the ships are coverd in engines.
	drone:
	    --
outer armor:
	hiveship:
	    large green armor on the sides of the ship, compleatly covering the sides. rarely on the front, and only then used to elevate positions of the mounts and only very sparcly. also, rarely on the back as well
	drone:
	    --
mount positions:
	hiveship:
	    mounts seem spread apart, with the bigger guns in the center, and the smaller ones in the outer ponits of the craft? im unsure...
	drone:
	    --, however, there is one ship with its larger mount at the front of the craft.
unarmerd sections:
	hiveship:
	    im unsure how to exsplan. plz hold...
	    ok, so, most of the craft is coverd in this 'grey' coloar, that looks a lot less like armor then the rest of the craft. but i think it is, just not the armor on the sides.
	    this armor tends to be more prealvent in the center, but always feels like a a a a a.
	    i cant exaplane. its were the green armor is not.
	drone:
	    --
hangers:
	hiveship:
	    on the front of the craft, always. also, sourounded by unarmerd sectrions. tend to be semetrical. built into the craft, built so the hanger entrence is on the very edge of the outline of the craft.
	drone:
        as drone desinges can differ from hiveships, i can be more creative here. but proboly should not, as doing so can cause me some issues latter, because the ships wont look like one group.
groves:
    hiveship:
        on the innor grew parts of the ship, there are a lot of, 'groves'. it took forever for me to realize what they are..
        they are wrinkles. like on a really old mans face. I dont know how to feel about this.
        but it does mean one thing: there is a 'base' color here, and the 'wrinkles' that take up most of the space make up the texture.
        i will have to try this out hopefully.
